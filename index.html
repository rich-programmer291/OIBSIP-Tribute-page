        <br><br><br>
        Stephen Hawking (1942-2018) was a renowned theoretical physicist, cosmologist,
        and author. Despite facing severe physical challenges due to amyotrophic
        lateral sclerosis (ALS), which he was diagnosed with at the age of 21,
        Hawking made groundbreaking contributions to the field of theoretical
        physics.<br><br>
        His most famous work includes the development of the theory of Hawking radiation,
        which suggested that black holes emit radiation and can eventually evaporate. This
        challenged existing ideas in physics and contributed to our understanding of black
        holes and quantum mechanics.

        <span class="bold">Black Hole Theory:</span><br><br>
        Hawking made his most famous contribution to physics with
        his work on black holes. He proposed the theory of Hawking radiation,
        suggesting that black holes are not completely black and can emit
        radiation, leading to their eventual evaporation.<br><br>
        <span class="bold">Cosmology: </span><br><br>
        Hawking worked on the nature of the universe's beginning and its
        eventual fate. His book "A Brief History of Time" became a bestseller
        and brought complex scientific concepts to a broader audience.<br><br>

        nature of the universe,covering topics such as black holes, the big bang, and the nature of time. It became a bestseller and is
        considered one of the most popular science books ever written.<br><br>
        <span class="bold">Black Holes and Baby Universes and Other Essays (1993): </span>This collection of essays delves into various scientific
        topics, including his own experiences and reflections on his life.<br><br>
        <span class="bold">The Universe in a Nutshell (2001): </span>Building on the success of "A Brief History of Time," this book explores
        the nature of
        the universe, covering topics like string theory and the fundamental forces of nature. It is illustrated with diagrams and illustrations to aid
        understanding.<br><br>
        <span class="bold"> A Briefer History of Time (2005):</span> Co-written with Leonard Mlodinow, this book is a condensed and updated version of
